# Smart-Disaster-Evacuation-Planner
Smart Disaster Evacuation Planner is a web-based system that calculates the safest and shortest evacuation routes between cities using real-time disaster risk data and distance values received from hardware. It uses Dijkstra’s Algorithm and displays routes on an interactive map, demonstrated using the Uttarakhand region.
